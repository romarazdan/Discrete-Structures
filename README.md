# Discrete-Structures
in Scheme | CS135

The aim of this course is to integrate knowledge of basic mathematics with the problems involving specification, design,
and computation. By the end of the course, the student should be able to: use sets, functions, lists, and relations in the
specification and design of problems; use properties of arithmetic, modular arithmetic (sum, product, exponentiation), prime
numbers, greatest common divisor, factoring, Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem; use binary, decimal, and base-b notation systems
and translation methods; use induction to design and verify recursive programs; and implement in Scheme all algorithms
considered during the course.
